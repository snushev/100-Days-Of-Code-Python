## 🐢 Turtle Graphics Projects

### 🇺🇸 U.S. States Game
Educational guessing game where the user identifies U.S. states on a blank map.  
Displays correct guesses directly on the map using Turtle graphics and saves missing states to `states_to_learn.csv`.

### 🏓 Pong Game
Classic Pong arcade game built with the Turtle module.  
Includes paddle and ball movement logic, scoring system, and collision detection.

### 🐍 Snake Game
Modern recreation of the Snake game using `turtle` graphics.  
Supports score tracking, collision detection, and replay functionality.
